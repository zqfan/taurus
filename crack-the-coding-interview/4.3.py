"""
Given a sorted (increasing order) array, write an algorithm to create a binary tree with
minimal height.

Analyse:
* I don't know why it mentions that the array is an increasing array.
* I think the minimal height binary tree is a balance tree, and the
method in binary_tree.BinaryTree.full_insert() will generate a tree
satisfy this problem.
