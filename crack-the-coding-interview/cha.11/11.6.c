/* 11.6
   How would you test an ATM in a distributed banking system?

   Analyze:
   1) latency, after one action, how long will it response?
   2) safety, if a operation fails, will it recover to the previous
   state?
   3) consistency, if two operation on a same account occur in the
   nearly same time, will it guarantee one and only one can success?
   4) Mean time failure, how long the atm will fail?
